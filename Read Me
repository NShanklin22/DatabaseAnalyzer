My full time job is a programmer for building automation controls, in this field there are many different common variables that are refered to by different names depending on the programmer.

Naturally as you might guess this can get pretty messy with a lot of variation from site to site.

To mitigate this mess my company follows a standard refered to as SEBA+, this is a recent change which means we have a lot of sites that do not have "standard" names.

The difficult thing about converting these sites is know what the most common incorrect names are without going controller by controller (easily more than 50+ controllers to a site with dozens of points each).

The help with this process I developed this software as a tool to allow a tech to load a database export, analyze it, and receive back a csv file with the incorrect names.

There are also a lot more feature that I plan to implement and am working on a running list of features I would like to implement.
